## Working on and contributing to the application
Create issues for feature suggestions and improvements, you can make pull requests as well. Just remember that they should stay in the theme of this application, if it's out of theme (e.g. giving too much focus and attention to one application), you can head over to "Working outside Tweak Utility".

## Working outside Tweak Utility
Tweak Utility offers extensibility options, this means you can add new tweaks to Tweak Utility without supervision. Information about extensions work is located [here](https://github.com/bluffingo/TweakUtility/wiki/Extensions).

## Working with the installer
Tweak Utility uses at the moment the [Microsoft Visual Studio Installer Projects](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioClient.MicrosoftVisualStudio2017InstallerProjects) template, if you don't install it the install project included won't load.

## What Visual Studio version to use

It is recommended to use 2019 for developing Tweak Utility. Older versions of Visual Studio may load TweakUtility but may send a lot of errors.
