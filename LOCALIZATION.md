# Localization in TweakUtility
Currently Tweak Utility uses Windows Forms as it's UI Framework, not new but functional.
You can grab the Strings.RESX file from [here](https://github.com/bluffingo/TweakUtility/raw/master/TweakUtility/Properties/Strings.resx), and edit it, a text editor (or Visual Studio if you can't read XML) should be enough.
If done, [create an issue](https://github.com/bluffingo/TweakUtility/issues/new?labels=localization) or contact [Craftplacer](https://github.com/Craftplacer). If accepted, the localization will be shipped in the next version of Tweak Utility alongside with a mention in the credits as translator.

## About the `&`
`&` are used in Windows Forms to give UI controls a keyboard shortcut, so if a control is labeled as "Being Tr__a__nslatable", you can activate/click it by pressing Alt+A.
