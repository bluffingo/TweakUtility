-Tweak Utility Easter Eggs-
These were originally in the source code, but have been placed here to clean the code.

In a nutshell, this is a relic of TweakUtility's early developement (from July to August)

I'M HAVING ATTENTION

[4:33 AM] Craftplacer: https://files.catbox.moe/hipgjk.png
[4:33 AM] Craftplacer: tech gore
[4:33 AM] Craftplacer: but self made
[4:34 AM] PF94: tweakutility's main gimmick is that it can customize your printer
[4:34 AM] Craftplacer: lmao
[4:34 AM] PF94: and put ink without buying ink

are we going to do #2 later? yeah why not

*crab rave literally in background* removing themes -Craftplacer
i'd prob keep plex as a easter egg. :P -PF94

what should be the new build number? 1.0.94 was already released, 1.0.95 (edit: that turned up to be 1.0.96) then. after build 95, it's build 98,
because WINDOWS 98 yes

[12:08 AM] PF94: also silk is used by roblox, so we're using roblox icons D:
[12:08 AM] Craftplacer: ignore the fact
[12:08 AM] Craftplacer: we just don't play roblox
[12:08 AM] Craftplacer: we never seen roblox
[12:09 AM] Craftplacer: roblox never existed to us
[12:09 AM] PF94: i used to, but now i give robux to some guy who wants to rejoin this "Soccer" group

empty passport idk why

@PF94, problem fixed :P

Can we check what version of Windows 10 the end user is running? I'm (PF94) running 1903 and the "Classic Volume" control doesn't work, The calender/clock hasen't worked since November Update or Aniversery update.
↑ technicly not a easter egg but i'll let it slide

damnit, my screen just froze and now firefox is laggy,
firefox is too lazy to load discord, i'm guessing my driver is glitchy or something
brb gonna load chrome, oh, it loaded, great
the day is saved, firefox decided to load discord.
